#summary Bits, bytes and binary logic

==Introduction==

When programming in any language, it is always important to understand your roots.
No, I'm not talking about BASIC or C, I'm talking about binary. All files, data and information used or stored in a computer is turned into bytecode.


==Details==

===Binary AND===
Here is an example in C that shows how to use the binary AND ('&'):

{{{
char result;
result = 0x25 & 3;
}}}

And here is the equivilant in binary math:

{{{
0001 1001 (this is 25 in binary)
&    0011 (AND 3)
0001 1000 (bits 1 and 2 are masked )
}}}

Here is a table showing how AND works:

||Bit||And||Bit|| = ||
|| 1 || & || 1 || 1 ||
|| 1 || & || 0 || 0 ||
|| 0 || & || 1 || 0 ||
|| 0 || & || 0 || 0 ||
